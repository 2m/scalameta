### Reflection core

Reflection core of [Project Palladium](http://scalamacros.org/news/2014/03/02/project-palladium.html) aka the new reflection API designed to be a maximally user-friendly and implementation-independent foundation for metaprogramming in Scala. Design notes can be found in the [Reflection API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CowAbpDOcyJyK8mECmEgel08lgmPcDCNnxAvcfudnf0/edit#heading=h.tbusdm4hbey6) document at [Palladium Shared](https://drive.google.com/#folders/0Bxbd8B9L-XfmcE9tRFBXVjZtY0k).

### How to use

The project is in a very early stage, so it's not supposed to be useful just yet. However, if you're brave enough, we have a nightly build that publishes artifacts to Sonatype at `"org.scalareflect" % "core_2.11" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"`.
